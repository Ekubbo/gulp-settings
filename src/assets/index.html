				Kyrie Andrew Irving is an American professional basketball player for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA).
				He was named NBA Rookie of the Year after being selected by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the first overall pick in the 2011 NBA draft. 
				A five-time NBA All-Star, Irving was selected to the All-NBA Third Team in 2015. He won an NBA championship with the Cavaliers in 2016.
				Irving played college basketball for the Duke Blue Devils before joining the Cavaliers in 2011. He was named the NBA All-Star Game Most
				Valuable Player (MVP) in 2014. In the 2016 NBA Finals, he made a three-point field goal with 53 seconds remaining in a tied Game 7 to 
				help lead the Cavaliers to a championship over the Golden State Warriors. After losing a rematch against the Warriors in the 2017 Finals, 
				Irving requested a trade, and was traded to the Boston Celtics. He has also played for the United States national team, with which he won 
				gold at the 2014 FIBA Basketball World Cup and the 2016 Summer Olympics. In 2018, he starred in the film Uncle Drew.
